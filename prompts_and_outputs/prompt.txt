Do create a basic web application using Flask with a simple UI (white background, black text, basic buttons).
The app should:
Have a dropdown to select from the list of available video indexes
Based on the selected index, show another dropdown listing the videos under that index
Display the thumbnail of the selected video alongside its video name
Include a button to run 12 Labs video analysis and generate a YouTube-ready description
Display the generated YouTube description on the page
Provide a “Copy” button to copy the description to clipboard
Keep the UI minimal, clean, and functional. Use Markdown-compatible output for the generated description.
