Please use 12 Labs (via MCP) to run full video analysis and extract all main topics and subtopics.
For each topic:
Create short atomic notes (maximum 5 lines per note)
Focus only on the core idea
Include closely related subtopics
Additionally:
Identify relationships between topics and subtopics
Link related notes using Obsidian-style backlinks ([[Note Name]])
Output requirements:
Each topic as a separate Markdown (.md) note
Obsidian-compatible formatting
Clear interconnections between notes
The final output should be ready to store directly in an Obsidian knowledge vault.
